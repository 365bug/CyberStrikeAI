# Self-update recovery and MCP edit fixes

## Intake (F0)

PR #346 was merged at 72cd8d62e36e536a6b18e9e10ea73d8d16294044 on explicit user direction to merge first and repair the reviewed defects afterwards. This is corrective work on branch `codex/self-update-recovery-fixes`; the checkout was clean. No release or deployment is requested.

Workflow gate: P10 feedback/iteration, implementation allowed. The frozen review at a63070d and executable PRR-002/PRR-007 counterexamples define the upstream contract; there are no missing product decisions. Acceptance requires preserved MCP stop state and refusal of ambiguous recovery before filesystem mutation.

Maintainability gate: `apply.go` has 1099 lines and combines recovery orchestration and filesystem IO; `external_mcp.go` has 508 lines. Risk is high for recovery. Allowed slice: narrow fix with a separate pure JSON/evidence validation module, small call-site changes, and focused regression tests. Broad refactoring is not required. Existing update/handler tests and reviewer reproductions cover the affected boundary.

## Requirements (F1, confirmed by the user's repair request)

- R1 / PRR-007: editing an existing MCP without an explicit enable/disable field preserves its runtime activation state. Explicit activation fields and Start/Stop remain supported; a new server defaults to enabled. Environment expansion remains isolated from persisted raw values.
- R2 / PRR-002: incomplete, null, duplicate-key, malformed, or contradictory recovery evidence cannot authorize a second swap, wrong rollback binary, or deletion of recovery records. Valid current records and the documented legacy marker retain safe recovery.
- Non-goals: redesigning update UX, changing release policy, or unrelated refactoring. The two nonblocking review observations are outside this corrective slice unless required by the evidence validation boundary.

## Design (F2)

Recovery remains an internal on-disk contract, with no new HTTP fields. Decode exact JSON field names and types, reject duplicate keys at every depth and null scalars, and reject unknown fields rather than interpreting a newer format as current evidence. The one documented plain-text legacy build marker remains supported by its existing conservative path.

For JSON build records require a target commit and exactly one proof of the old binary (SHA256 or explicit absence), validate hash/commit shapes, and reconcile the record with any persisted State for the same update or its immediate predecessor. Before restoring protected content or building, verify the live/previous files match the indicated pre-swap or post-swap phase. A successful State cannot be reinterpreted as an owed build.

Rollback records require an explicit restore_binary decision; reconcile it, the live/previous hashes and the nested State, then compare with the persisted State when it still exists. Missing persisted State is allowed after the final cleanup crash window, but the self-contained record must remain coherent. Invalid evidence returns an existing state_unreadable/bad_state error and preserves recovery files.

MCP request decoding retains field presence separately from bool values. For existing entries, omission preserves the manager's activation state; explicit disabled or external_mcp_enable fields determine it. New entries default to enabled. Keep raw configuration persistence and environment-expanded connection snapshots separate as today.

Compatibility: properly written current journals remain readable, legacy plain-text recovery remains guarded; hand-edited or unsupported JSON requires manual correction instead of guessed mutation. Rollback of this patch restores old behavior and is not recommended while invalid journals remain.

## Implementation plan (F3)

1. Add recovery evidence parser/validators in a separate internal/update module; add narrow calls in build/rollback readers and pre-mutation paths. Keep producer formats unchanged.
2. Preserve explicit field presence in the MCP request without changing its JSON shape; normalize enable state against the existing manager configuration.
3. Promote the two failing review reproductions into portable regression tests; add duplicate/null/type/contradiction matrices and valid retry controls. Assert no build/swap, unchanged binaries and preserved journals for refusals.
4. Run update/handler targeted suites and race checks, full Go tests, build, JS and shell checks; update changelog and verification record. Open a corrective PR and integrate the verified patch as part of the authorized merge-and-fix task, respecting repository checks.

Docs: this phase record plus concise behavior notes in deployment/developer documentation if needed. No screenshots or production external services are required; tests use local Git and harmless command/HTTP markers. No version bump, tag or release publication.
